        <h4>What is cholesterol?</h4>
        <p>
            Cholesterol is a waxy substance found in your blood. Your body needs cholesterol to build healthy cells, but high levels of cholesterol can increase your risk of heart disease. With high cholesterol, you can develop fatty deposits in your&nbsp;blood&nbsp;vessels.

        <p>
            Cholesterol is essential for your body to work, although too much ‘bad cholesterol’ (called low-density lipoprotein or LDL) can lead to fatty deposits building up in your arteries. These fatty deposits can increase your risk of developing conditions such as coronary heart disease, heart attack and stroke.
        </p>

        <h4>The common symptoms to diagnose cholesterol yourself</h4> 
        <p>
            According to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), a person's first cholesterol screening should occur between the ages of 9 and 11, and then be repeated every five years after that.<br>The NHLBI recommends that cholesterol screenings occur every one to two years for men ages 45 to 65 and for women ages 55 to 65. People over 65 should receive cholesterol tests annually. Lose weight without trying If your test results aren't within desirable ranges, your doctor might recommend more-frequent measurements. Your doctor might also suggest more-frequent tests if you have a family history of high cholesterol, heart disease or other risk factors, such as diabetes or high blood pressure.

        <h4>Effects of cholesterol</h4>
        <p>
            1. Heart Disease: High levels of cholesterol can lead to the formation of plaques in your arteries, a condition known as atherosclerosis. This narrows the arteries and restricts blood flow to the heart, increasing the risk of heart attack and other cardiovascular diseases.<br>
            2. Stroke: When plaque buildup occurs in the arteries leading to the brain, it can cause a stroke by blocking blood flow or rupturing and causing a blood clot.<br>
            3. Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD): Cholesterol buildup can also occur in arteries outside the heart, particularly in the legs. This can lead to PAD, which causes reduced blood flow to the limbs, leading to pain, numbness, and potentially tissue damage.<br>
            4. High Blood Pressure: Cholesterol buildup can contribute to high blood pressure, which further strains the heart and increases the risk of heart disease and stroke.
