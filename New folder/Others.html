    <h1 style="font-size:60px;">Hemoglobin</h1>

    </center>
</a>
<h4>What is hemoglobin?</h4>
<p>Hemoglobin is a type of protein in your red blood cells that distributes the oxygen you breathe to muscles and tissues throughout your body. Without oxygen, your muscles would not have the energy they need to function normally.

    Hemoglobin also picks up carbon dioxide and returns it to your lungs for you to exhale. This essential process helps prevent toxic levels of carbon dioxide.
    
    Iron, a mineral you get from food, is a key component of hemoglobin. Iron helps hemoglobin bind to oxygen so the hemoglobin can transport the oxygen to your tissues. Iron is what makes your blood red.</p>

        </center>


<h4>Symptoms to diagnose hemoglobin deficiency</h4>
<p>Fatigue — feeling too tired to manage your activities<br>
    Chest pain.<br>
Dizziness.<br>
Frequent infections.<br>
Heart palpitations.<br>
Headache.<br>
Pallor (skin color that’s paler than usual).<br>
Pulsatile tinnitus.<br>
Shortness of breath (dyspnea).
<br></p>

<h4>Diet one should follow</h4>

<p>
    Choose iron-rich foods
    Foods rich in iron include:
    
    Red meat, pork and poultry
    Seafood
    Beans
    Dark green leafy vegetables, such as spinach
    Dried fruit, such as raisins and apricots
    Iron-fortified cereals, breads and pastas
    Peas<br>
    Your body absorbs more iron from meat than it does from other sources. If you choose to not eat meat, you may need to increase your intake of iron-rich, plant-based foods to absorb the same amount of iron as does someone who eats meat.<br>
    
    Choose foods containing vitamin C to enhance iron absorption
    You can enhance your body's absorption of iron by drinking citrus juice or eating other foods rich in vitamin C at the same time that you eat high-iron foods. Vitamin C in citrus juices, like orange juice, helps your body to better absorb dietary iron.<br>

<h4>effects of hemoglobin deficiency</h4>

<p>
    Women. Because women lose blood during menstruation, women in general are at greater risk of iron deficiency anemia.<BR>
    Infants and children. Infants, especially those who were low birth weight or born prematurely, who don't get enough iron from breast milk or formula may be at risk of iron deficiency. Children need extra iron during growth spurts. If your child isn't eating a healthy, varied diet, he or she may be at risk of anemia.<BR>
    Vegetarians. People who don't eat meat may have a greater risk of iron deficiency anemia if they don't eat other iron-rich foods.<BR>
    Frequent blood donors. People who routinely donate blood may have an increased risk of iron deficiency anemia since blood donation can deplete iron stores.<BR> Low hemoglobin related to blood donation may be a temporary problem remedied by eating more iron-rich foods. If you're told that you can't donate blood because of low hemoglobin, ask your doctor whether you should be concerned<BR>

<H4>What is CBC?</H4>

<P>A complete blood count, or CBC, is an easy and very common test that screens for certain disorders that can affect your health.

    A CBC determines if there are any increases or decreases in your blood cell counts. Normal values vary depending on your age and your gender. Your lab report will tell you the normal value range for your age and gender.
    
    A CBC can help diagnose a broad range of conditions, from anemia and infection to cancer.

    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_B12">
        <h1 style="font-size:60px;">Vitamni B12</h1>
    
</a>

</center>

<h4>What is viamin B12 ?</h4>


<p>

    Vitamin B12, or cobalamin, is naturally found in animal foods. It can also be added to foods or supplements. Vitamin B12 is needed to form red blood cells and DNA. It is also a key player in the function and development of brain and nerve cells.

Vitamin B12 binds to the protein in the foods we eat. In the stomach, hydrochloric acid and enzymes unbind vitamin B12 into its free form. From there, vitamin B12 combines with a protein called intrinsic factor so that it can be absorbed further down in the small intestine.
</p>


<h4>Diet to be followed</h4>
<p>
    Animal liver and kidneys<br>
    Clams are small, chewy shellfish that are packed with nutrients<br>
    Sardines are small, soft-boned saltwater fish. They’re usually sold canned in water, oil, or sauces, though you can also buy them fresh.<br>
    This source of vitamin B12 may work well for vegetarians and vegans because it’s synthetically made and not derived from animal sources.<br>

<h4>effects of vitamin B12 deficiency

</h4>


<p>
    Atrophic gastritis, in which your stomach lining has thinned<br>
Pernicious anemia, which makes it hard for your body to absorb vitamin B12<br>
Conditions that affect your small intestine, such as Crohn's disease, celiac disease, bacterial growth, or a parasite<br>
Misused alcohol or drank heavily, which can make it harder for your body to absorb nutrients or prevent you from eating enough calories. One sign that you lack enough B12 may be glossitis, or a swollen, inflamed tongue.<br>
Immune system disorders, such as Graves' disease or lupus<br>
