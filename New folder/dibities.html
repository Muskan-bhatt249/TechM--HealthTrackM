<H4>What is Diabaties?</H4>
<p>Diabetes is a chronic disease that occurs either when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin or when the body cannot effectively use the insulin it produces. Insulin is a hormone that regulates blood glucose. Hyperglycaemia, also called raised blood glucose or raised blood sugar, is a common effect of uncontrolled diabetes and over time leads to serious damage to many of the body's systems, especially the nerves and blood vessels.

<h4>Tips that can reduce your suger level</h4>
<p>Exercise increases insulin sensitivity and helps your muscles use blood sugar for movement. This can lead to reduced blood sugar levels.<br>
    Your body breaks down the carbs you eat into glucose, which then raises your blood sugar levels. As such, reducing your carb intake can aid blood sugar regulation.<br>
    Eating plenty of fiber can aid blood sugar management. Soluble dietary fiber appears to be more effective than insoluble fiber for this purpose.<br>
    Focusing on your portion sizes can help you manage your blood sugar levels.<br>
    Good sleep helps maintain your blood sugar levels and promotes a healthy weight.<br>
