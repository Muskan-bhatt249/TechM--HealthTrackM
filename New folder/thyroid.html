<H4>What is Thyroid?</H4>
<p>The thyroid is a small, butterfly-shaped gland located at the base of the neck, just below the Adam's apple. The thyroid gland makes two main hormones: thyroxine (T-4) and triiodothyronine (T-3). These hormones affect every cell in the body. They support the rate at which the body uses fats and carbohydrates.

</p>
<p>The thyroid gland is controlled by the pituitary gland in the brain, which produces thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) to regulate the thyroid's hormone production. When the thyroid gland produces too much or too little hormone, it can lead to various health problems, such as hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism, respectively.</p>

    3. Changes in Skin and Hair: Thyroid disorders can affect the skin and hair. Hypothyroidism may cause dry, rough skin, brittle nails, and hair loss, while hyperthyroidism can lead to sweaty or oily skin, hair thinning, and brittle nails.<BR>
    4. Muscle and Joint Pain: Thyroid disorders can cause muscle weakness, stiffness, and joint pain. Hypothyroidism may lead to generalized muscle aches and stiffness, while hyperthyroidism can cause muscle weakness and tremors.<br>
